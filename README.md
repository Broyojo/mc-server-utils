# Minecraft Server Utilities

Note: I have stopped working on this project and begun work on a more refined version of a server manager, located [here](https://github.com/Broyojo/server).

## Description
This is a set of simple Minecraft server utilities that help me to manage my server of a few friends. These tools help me to start/stop servers, backup servers (optionally on a schedule), and make an isometric 3D render of servers using [Minecraft Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/). Each tool has its own script file. In addition to Minecraft related utilities, it helps me monitor temperature of the server CPU, perform full system backups, and helps me refresh SSH access to the server using my Github SSH keys. 

## How To Run It
To run any of the tools, simply run
```
$ python3 <tool_name>.py
```
